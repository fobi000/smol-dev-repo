1. "index.html": This is the main HTML file that will contain the structure of the website. It will include references to the "styles.css" and "tailwind.css" files. It will contain various DOM elements with unique id names that can be used by JavaScript functions.

2. "styles.css": This is the main CSS file that will contain custom styles for the website. It will depend on the DOM elements defined in the "index.html" file. It will also override or complement some of the styles defined in the "tailwind.css" file.

3. "tailwind.css": This is the CSS file for Tailwind CSS, a utility-first CSS framework. It will provide the base styles for the website, which can be customized further in the "styles.css" file. It will also depend on the DOM elements defined in the "index.html" file.

Shared Dependencies:

1. DOM Element IDs: These are unique identifiers for HTML elements that can be used by CSS for styling and by JavaScript for manipulating the elements. The exact names will depend on the structure and content of the website, but they should be consistent across the "index.html", "styles.css", and "tailwind.css" files.

2. CSS Classes: These are identifiers for groups of styling rules in CSS. They can be defined in both the "styles.css" and "tailwind.css" files and used in the "index.html" file to apply styles to HTML elements.

3. Media Queries: These are conditions in CSS that apply different styles for different devices and screen sizes. They can be defined in both the "styles.css" and "tailwind.css" files and will affect the styles of the HTML elements in the "index.html" file.

4. CSS Variables: These are reusable values in CSS that can be used to maintain consistency and reduce redundancy in the styles. They can be defined in both the "styles.css" and "tailwind.css" files and used in the "index.html" file to apply styles to HTML elements.
