Since the tech stack specified does not include JavaScript, there will be no exported variables, id names of DOM elements for JavaScript functions, message names, or function names to consider. 

However, the shared dependencies between the files "index.html", "styles.css", and "tailwind.css" are:

1. HTML Elements and their Class Names: The HTML elements defined in "index.html" will have class names that correspond to the classes defined in both "styles.css" and "tailwind.css". These class names are shared dependencies between the files.

2. CSS Selectors: The CSS selectors used in "styles.css" and "tailwind.css" will be dependent on the HTML structure and elements defined in "index.html". 

3. Tailwind CSS Framework: The "tailwind.css" file is a dependency for the "index.html" and "styles.css" files, as it provides the Tailwind CSS framework that is used for styling the website.

4. CSS Rules: The CSS rules defined in "styles.css" and "tailwind.css" will be applied to the HTML elements in "index.html". These rules are shared dependencies between the files.

5. Media Queries: If there are any responsive design elements, the media queries defined in "styles.css" and "tailwind.css" will be dependent on the HTML structure and elements defined in "index.html". 

6. Link to External Resources: The link to the Twitter profile "@fobi000" is a shared resource between the files.
